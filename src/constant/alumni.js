                On a quiet and rainy evening of 25" August 1972, Five of us made a
                journey from East to West, City of Bombay, now Mumbai for our
                livelihood and also to create a vibration on our professional
                adventure following the footsteps of our seniors in the then

              </p>
              <p>
                I think none of us has shifted their focus from our initial day
                and now has grown up, elevated and established as an Elite
                Technocrat. At times, then, we were very curious to know about
                what our future in terms of work and family holds and were very
                happy but nervous as well Today the curtain of our past has
                unfoided and we know what we are now and would be in the near
                future.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I may not like to gauge my professional carrier by any
                conventional barometer but feel satisfied and convinced that my
                limited talent was efficiently and honestly utlised for the

                with who 1 am connected to appropriately in a larger sense

                I think none of us has shifted their focus from our initial day
                and now has grown up, elevated and established as an Elite
                Technocrat. At times, then, we were very curious to know about
                what our future in terms of work and family holds and were very
                happy but nervous as well Today the curtain of our past has
                unfoided and we know what we are now and would be in the near
                future.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I may not like to gauge my professional carrier by any
                conventional barometer but feel satisfied and convinced that my
                limited talent was efficiently and honestly utlised for the
                betterment and opening the opportunily for the next generation
                with who 1 am connected to appropriately in a larger sense
                professionally
